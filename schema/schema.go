package schema

// Schema is used to define the shape of practitioner-provider information,
// like resources, data sources, and providers. Think of it as a type
// definition, but for Terraform.
type Schema struct {
	// Attributes are the fields inside the resource, provider, or data
	// source that the schema is defining. The map key should be the name
	// of the attribute, and the body defines how it behaves. Names must
	// only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
	Attributes map[string]Attribute

	// Version indicates the current version of the schema. Schemas are
	// versioned to help with automatic upgrade process. Whenever you have
	// a change in the schema you'd like to provide a manual migration for,
	// you should increment that schema's version by one.
